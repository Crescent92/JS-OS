To boot floppy.img on a physical machine, a blank usb drive that is formated in FAT32 is required.

Follow the following steps...
(This is done through command-line on a unix based system)

	-cd to <your_directory_path>/JS-OS/
	-run the following commands in shell
	**************WARNING**************
	This will erase and replace any content found in the /boot/ directory along with the 
            directory itself (presented it exists) of that drive, JS-OS nor its contributers and
	developers are NOT responsible for any data loss. THIS SOFTWARE COMES WITH
            NO WARRENTY WHATSOEVER. USE AT OWN RISK.
	**************WARNING**************
	-./usb_make.sh -d (drive location, e.g., /media/<USB_LABEL>)
