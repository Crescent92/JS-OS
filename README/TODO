Items that need to be completed or fixed include:

Add a stdout, stderror, 
Fix k_programs, fdc driver, ext2 fs to make the programs decent in error correction and more stable upon errors

ELF execution
Proper fopen and fclose for the vfs
file locks for the floppy ext2 file system

Fix kheap problem
	When unifing right in the free function, a heap array header may be found,
		but is not in the actual array list. There has been a work around applied 
		where the operating system detects the flase header, deletes it an moves 
		on with the freeing of the pointer.
