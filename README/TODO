Items that need to be completed include:

ELF execution
fopen and fclose for the vfs
file locks for the floppy ext2 file system

Fix kheap problem
	When unifing right in the free function, a heap array header may be found,
		but is not in the actual array list. There has been a work around applied 
		where the operating system detects the flase header, deletes it an moves 
		on with the freeing of the pointer.
